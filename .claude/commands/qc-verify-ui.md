Phase: $ARGUMENTS

Inputs:
- @.planning/pm/current/PRD.md
- @.planning/pm/current/STORIES.md
- @.planning/pm/current/HANDOFF.md
- @.planning/pm/current/RISK-IMPACT.md
- @.planning/pm/current/QC-REPORT.md
- @.planning/discovery/current/UI-CONTRACT.md
- @.claude/scripts/atlassian_cli.py

</context>

<process>
1. Build verification checklist from story acceptance criteria, release gate, and QA-ISSUE-TAXONOMY.
2. Use Browser MCP to run functional flow checks for critical user journeys.
3. Validate high/critical risk mitigations from `RISK-IMPACT.md` via targeted checks.
4. If design links exist in HANDOFF:
   - Figma MCP must be called for DS-critical assertions,
   - QC output must include explicit Figma evidence per critical screen/component.
5. If no Figma design source exists, use `.planning/discovery/current/UI-CONTRACT.md` for DS-critical assertions.
6. Classify every issue with:
   - severity (critical/high/medium/low)
   - category (visual-ui/functional/ux/content/performance/console-errors/accessibility)
7. Mark each check as PASS/FAIL with evidence and reproduction steps.
8. Write QC report using QA-REPORT-TEMPLATE to `.planning/pm/current/QC-REPORT.md`.
9. Write a QC audit file in `.planning/audit/` using `AUDIT-STEP-TEMPLATE`.
10. Gate rule:
   - PASS only if all critical functional checks pass and no DS-critical violation remains.
11. If a Jira issue key is linked in handoff and gate is PASS, suggest transition via `atlassian_cli.py suggest` and require explicit user confirmation before any apply step.
12. Output final gate decision and exact blockers to fix.
