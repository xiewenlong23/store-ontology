1. Fetch PR feedback:
   - run `python3 .claude/scripts/github_pr_feedback.py --pr "$ARGUMENTS" --pretty`
   - store outputs in:
     - `.planning/pm/current/PR-FEEDBACK.json`
     - `.planning/pm/current/PR-FEEDBACK.md`
2. Triage and classify:
   - separate issue comments, review comments, review summaries.
   - map each actionable item to module/file and estimate severity.
   - update `.planning/pm/current/RISK-IMPACT.md` if risk profile changes.
3. Discuss resolution strategy for unresolved high/critical feedback before implementation.
4. Implement fixes in brownfield-safe increments.
5. Run strict gate:
   - run `fad:quality-gate` for changed scope.
6. Security gate is included in strict gate.
7. Run QC retest policy:
   - targeted retest for changed scope,
   - plus smoke checks on critical flow.
   - if design links exist, include Figma/Browser MCP evidence.
8. Write audit log in `.planning/audit/` including:
   - PR source and fetched evidence,
   - fix decisions,
   - gate results,
   - remaining concerns/blockers.
9. End with explicit status: `DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT`.
