<process>
1. Decompose feature into independent workstreams (API, UI, tests, docs, integration).
2. Spawn parallel agents for disjoint write scopes.
3. Keep one integration lane that only merges/reconciles outputs.
4. Gate merge by:
   - requirement coverage
   - test pass
   - risk mitigation coverage
   - brownfield guardrail compliance
5. Run strict post-merge gate:
   - run `fad:quality-gate`,
   - block release lane if strict gate is blocked.
6. Security gate is included in strict gate.
7. Publish a unified implementation summary and next-step checklist.
8. Write swarm execution audit log in `.planning/audit/`.
