# Structs
A **struct** is an Ontology property [base type](/docs/foundry/object-link-types/base-types/) that allows users to create schema-based properties with multiple fields. Struct properties are created from struct type dataset columns. Struct property fields can have different data sources as long as the property is transformed into a single struct type column before being defined in the Ontology.

Struct property fields can have different data sources as long as the property is transformed into a single struct type column before being defined in the Ontology.
Many common object properties can be modeled as structs. For example, a `Full Name` property with the fields `First Name` and `Last Name`, or an `Address` property that includes `Street`, `City`, `Postal Code`, and `Country` fields.

## Struct configuration
The following is a list of struct property constraints and allowed configurations:
The following is a list of struct property constraints and allowed configurations:
* Structs have a depth of one and cannot be nested.
* Structs must have at least 1 field.
* Only the following field types are currently supported:
* `BOOLEAN`
* `BYTE`
* `DATE`
* `DECIMAL`
* `DOUBLE`
* `FLOAT`
* `GEOPOINT`
* `INTEGER`
* `LONG`
* `SHORT`
* `STRING`
* `TIMESTAMP`

## Query semantics
Structs are indexed similarly to [ElasticSearch object field types ↗](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/object), which means that arrays can have unintuitive behavior. For example, if you have an array of `Full Name` properties, an object containing `[{"firstName": "Harvey", "lastName": "Dent"}, {"firstName": "Two", "lastName": "Face"}]` would match a query for `"firstName": "Harvey" AND "lastName": "Face"`. The two conditions are treated independently, rather than requiring to match on the same struct within the array.

## Current levels of support
As support for struct property types expands, availability will vary across the Palantir platform.

Structs are currently supported in the following applications and services:
* **[Ontology Manager](/docs/foundry/ontology-manager/overview/):** Define and edit structs.
* **[Actions](/docs/foundry/action-types/overview/):** Use actions to [create and modify struct property values](/docs/foundry/action-types/actions-on-structs/).
* **[Pipeline Builder](/docs/foundry/pipeline-builder/overview/):** Define and edit structs.
* **[Workshop](/docs/foundry/workshop/overview/):** Display and use struct properties as variables.
* **[Marketplace](/docs/foundry/marketplace/overview/):** Package and install struct properties.
* **[Object Explorer](/docs/foundry/object-explorer/search-objects/):** Search for objects by their struct property values (struct field search is under development).
* **[Ontology SDK](/docs/foundry/ontology-sdk/overview/):** Load struct properties and search for objects by their struct property values in Ontology SDK applications. Not all Ontology SDKs support struct properties. Refer to the OSDK [unsupported property types](/docs/foundry/ontology-sdk/unsupported-types/#object-types-unsupported-property-types) for more information.
